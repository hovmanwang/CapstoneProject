# CapstoneProject
Project Motivation This is the final capstone project for Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree. I have chosen the Starbucks Project. This project is about the offers Starbucks have given to some customers who have registered on the Starbucks App. Some customers will complete the offers they receive, while some will not. From the Starbucks' perspective, not only will a incomplete offer result in lower income/profit, it will also include an unnecessary cost in the generation and provision of the offer to the customer. Therefore we have performed this analysis in hope to help Starbucks understand the drivers for offer completion, and in turn help the company enhance the offer performance.

Questions we intend to answer:

Which type of customers, in terms of their demographics such as age etc, are most responsive towards offers? 

Does there exist any customer/offer combination that performs particularly well in terms of completion rate?

What kind of offers are best received by the customers?


Ultimately, the most important question: what recommendations can be provided, based on our analysis, for Starbucks to leverage on and improve its offers' performance?

Files in the Repository

Starbucks_Capstone_notebook_HW.ipynb - final version of the ipynb file. All of the working is included. So are the graphs and tables. I have also put in a lot of narrative in preparation for the medium post.

data directory - the 3 files provided by Udacity/Starbucks: portfolio, profile, transcript

images directory - the charts we have generated and put into the Medium post. These are visible in the ipynb file as well.

Acknowledgements: The 3 raw datasets, portolio, profile and transcript, were prepared and made available by Udacity through collaboration with Starbucks.

Thanks to Udacity for a great project and I look forward to the next few ones.
